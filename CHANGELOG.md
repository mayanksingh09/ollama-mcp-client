## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 0.x to 1.0

The 1.0 release includes breaking changes:

1. **Client Initialization**: The client constructor now requires explicit configuration
2. **Method Signatures**: Several methods have been updated for consistency
3. **Error Handling**: New error types have been introduced

See the [Migration Guide](./docs/migration/0.x-to-1.0.md) for detailed instructions.
