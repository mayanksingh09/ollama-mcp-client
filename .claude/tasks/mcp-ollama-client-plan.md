# MCP Client Powered by Ollama - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client that uses Ollama as the LLM backend, enabling local AI-powered interactions with MCP servers while maintaining complete data privacy.

## Architecture Components
- **MCP Client**: TypeScript-based client implementing the MCP specification
