# MCP Client Powered by Ollama - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client that uses Ollama as the LLM backend, enabling local AI-powered interactions with MCP servers while maintaining complete data privacy.

## Architecture Components
- **MCP Client**: TypeScript-based client implementing the MCP specification
- **Ollama Integration**: Local LLM provider for processing and reasoning
- **Transport Layer**: Support for stdio and HTTP-based MCP server connections
- **Tool Orchestration**: Manage tool calls between Ollama and MCP servers

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation
- [x] Initialize TypeScript project with Node.js
- [x] Set up project structure with proper directories (src/, tests/, docs/)
- [x] Configure TypeScript with strict typing (tsconfig.json)
- [x] Install core dependencies (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, axios, etc.)
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [x] Create package.json with scripts for build, test, and dev
- [x] Initialize Git repository and create .gitignore

### Phase 2: Ollama Integration Layer
- [x] Create Ollama API client wrapper
- [x] Implement chat completion endpoint integration (/api/chat)
